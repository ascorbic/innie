# Onboarding Automation

## Problem

New engineers joining the team spend their first week:
- Chasing access requests through multiple systems
- Finding out-of-date documentation
- Not knowing who to ask about what

The process is scattered across Notion, Slack threads, and tribal knowledge.

## Desired Outcome

A streamlined onboarding experience where:
1. New hires have a clear checklist that tracks completion
2. Access requests are batched and tracked
3. Key people/teams are introduced proactively
4. First-week goals are clear and achievable

## Research Tasks

- [ ] Audit current onboarding docs – where do they live, how stale are they?
- [ ] Interview 2-3 recent joiners about pain points
- [ ] Map out all access requests needed (GitHub, AWS, internal tools)
- [ ] Identify who owns what systems

## Implementation Ideas

- Notion template with embedded checklists
- Slack workflow for access request batching
- "Who to ask about X" reference doc
- Week 1 buddy pairing system

## Notes

*Add findings and decisions here as the project progresses*
