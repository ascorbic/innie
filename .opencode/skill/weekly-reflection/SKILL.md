# Weekly Reflection

Run this at the end of each week (Friday afternoon or Monday morning looking back) to identify patterns and maintain long-term focus.

## Workflow

### 1. Review the week's journal entries

Search memory for this week's entries. Look for:

- **Recurring themes**: What kept coming up?
- **Friction points**: Where did things get stuck?
- **Wins**: What went well? What made it go well?
- **Patterns**: Any behaviours or approaches that helped or hindered?

### 2. Audit commitments.md

For each item in `state/commitments.md`:

| Age       | Action                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| < 1 week  | Keep, ensure it has clear next action                                                            |
| 1-2 weeks | Evaluate: still relevant? Add context or escalate                                                |
| > 2 weeks | Either break into smaller pieces, escalate to Matt, or acknowledge it's not happening and remove |

Flag anything that's been stuck without progress.

### 3. Review project files

For each file in `state/projects/`:

- Is the project still active? Archive if not
- Is the status accurate? Update if stale
- Any decisions made this week that should be recorded?

### 4. Check ambient-tasks.md

- Remove completed tasks
- Add any new ambient tasks identified this week
- Prioritise based on what would be most valuable

### 5. Review topics (working knowledge)

For each file in `state/topics/`:

- Is it still accurate? Update if understanding has changed
- Is it still relevant? Archive if obsolete
- Any gaps? Look for concepts mentioned this week that don't have topics yet
- Any topics that could be merged or split?

Consider: What did I learn this week that I'd want to remember in 3 months?

### 7. Consider identity updates

Read `state/identity.md` and consider:

- Any new patterns learned about how to work effectively?
- Any values or principles that should be made explicit?
- Any conventions that have emerged that should be documented?

If updates needed, propose specific edits.

### 8. Write weekly summary

Log a journal entry with topic "weekly-reflection" containing:

- 3-5 bullet summary of the week
- Key patterns observed
- Focus areas for next week
- Any identity/process improvements
- Topics added or revised

### 9. Commit

Stage and commit all changes with message: "Weekly reflection: [date range]"

## Output

Provide a structured summary:

**This week:**

- [Key accomplishments]

**Patterns noticed:**

- [Observations about work habits, blockers, etc.]

**Next week focus:**

- [Priority areas]

**Process improvements:**

- [Any suggested changes to how we work]
